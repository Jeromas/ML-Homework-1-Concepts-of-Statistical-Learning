## 📘 Topics Explored

- Bias-Variance Tradeoff  
- Flexible vs. Inflexible Models  
- Classification vs. Regression  
- Inference vs. Prediction  
- Understanding modeling scenarios (n, p, goals)  
- Real-world applications of statistical learning  
- Exploratory data analysis with the `College` dataset

---

## 🧪 Practical Component (R)

The R-based analysis includes:
- Loading and summarizing the `College` dataset from the **ISLR2** package
- Creating visualizations using `pairs()`, `boxplot()`, and `hist()`
- Feature engineering (e.g., creating an "Elite" variable)
- Building a linear regression model to explore relationships between institutional features and enrollment
